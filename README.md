What were the challenges you faced?
  Integrating a camera feed for Augmented Reality and another for Vision in Machine Learning on the same page was not possible   so we needed to combine both in one. Additionally decode the request object from Google Translate required significant work.

If you had more time, what would you focus on?
  I would make the 3dDraw smoother and not rerun multiple configurations.

Whatâ€™s the business value / opportunity of this app?
  This app can easily be implemented in all schools and can revolutionize education. 
  
What is your plan for the app/idea post hackathon?
  I would genuinely like to approach school districts with this app as it can help many students especially in times like       these where Distance Learning is required.

What was the inspiration of the idea?
  I have many friends who say that learning is simply boring and that they wish there was a way to only use hands-on             interactive learning. I also see many foreign students who are hindered due to their language barrier.

Who are your target users?
  My target users are teachers and students.

App abc is very similar. What makes yours unique?
  Drawing in 3d space has never been achieved and this technology can be used in a multitude of other places. It simply seems   like something out of a science fiction movie. Also a universal translator helps millions of student worldwide. The UI is     also very easy to navigate.
